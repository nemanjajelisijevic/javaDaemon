What is it?

	JavaDaemon is a framework for creating multithreaded and reactive apps in Java. I found it to be useful for making games.
	2D games for now, but I recently started working on incorporating it with OpenGl and hope to build a full blown 3D game engine.

	And this is my first step towards producing a multiplatform game development framework, purely based on Java as the language 
	of choice. Of course, not something that could compare to big AAA game engines, but something that could be useful and fun 
	to use.
	
	That being said, it is not bound to game development only, it can be used in various kind of apps (Android, java desktop
	apps, even server side stuff...).

	With little modifications, it can be made to work with Kotlin too.

	Its pure Java, so no platform dependencies.

About multithreading and concurrency:

	Multithreading is important in todays software development, as it allows the program to leverage the power of
	multiple CPU cores, executng tasks fully in parrallel, making the program faster and more modular in a sense of
	distributing tasks. 
	
	But programming a multithreaded app with only the language constructs like threads and synchronization primitives can
	be hard and tedious task. Many frameworks include their own solution for easing the concurrency usage by the app developer,
	and there is a variety of libraries and frameworks to choose from.
	
	Currently, one of most popular Java libraries is Recative Extensions for Java or RXJava, which I use at work on daily basis.

	JavaDaemon has the same goal as ReactiveX (RXJava) library, but different approach. Like RXJava its a combination of OOP
	and functional programming. While RX framework is based on Observer software design pattern which can decouple subscribers
	and observers, not just to be independent compilation units and help code reuse, but to run in different threads, this
	framework is based on Active Object concurrency pattern and producer-consumer app building pattern.

	Concurrency on steroids, is maybe a better way to describe it.

Wait, what are those mentioned patterns?

	The Active Object design pattern decouples method execution from method invocation for objects that each reside in their 
	own thread of control.
	The Producer/Consumer pattern is used to decouple processes that produce and consume data at different rates.

So, to start off with the basics.

Conteptual overview of javaDaemon

	Daemon framework is based on two main components: Daemons and Consumers.
	For the sake of clarity, the concept of Consumers will be explained first. 
	Its a pretty common concept, so if it bores you, just skip it, but I found, as I was learning programming, every explanation 
	is valuable.

	Consumer:

		The most used architecture in non-server (client) application frameworks is the event-loop based one. And I've done 
		Android, C++ with Qt, Windows Visual C++...

		Event loop (also called a consumer thread) is, as the word says: a loop. A loop that is executed by a dedicated thread, 
		and holds a certain condition (synchronization primitive) to regulate its idle time (awaiting on a condition) so it
		wouldn't eat up CPU cycles needlessly when there is nothing to be computed. Thus, its only active when an event is
		dispatched to it, it reacts to the event by running some developer specifiied procedure.

		Usually, event loop is waiting while some data structure (queue) associated with it, is empty. Queue being empty 
		represents the condition to idle, and when an event is dispatched it means that the event is enqueued to the queue, so
		it can be retrieved by event loop and used in the event handling procedure developer specifies. Events are created as a 
		result of some specific task hat has been executed in some other threads context (producer thread). All together, they 
		represent the producer-consumer scenario. 

		As every program starts with the programs one thread executing the main function. Somewhere in that function (ussually 
		after setting up and allocating all of the needed frameworks runtime data and other threads for running the bussines 
		logic code), that main thread is stuck in an event-loop. Its commonly called GUI thread as it works with the Graphical 
		User Interface (updating the GUI components like texts and images, as well as reacting to user controls like buttons 
		etc.). Conventionally, its not recomended to run bussines logic code in the gui thread, especially if that code takes
		some time to execute, since it will block the main thread and cause the user interface halt (app not responding).

		So delegating the business logic tasks to other threads in application is desired (like reacting to the button click 
		that symbolyzes a task to be done), and when those tasks are done an event is sent form the tasks thread to the GUI 
		threads' event loop to update the views.

		As in some other frameworks, an event in JavaDaemon is the Runnable object and its specializations in form of Closures, 
		which are objects that just encapsulate the algorithm to be executed or plainly - function objects. Closure (in Java 8 
		java.utils.function its called Consumer, but I feel like thats not a very suitable name) is like a Runnable, but it has 
		one argument to be passed.

		Those objects are the base of functional programming (in Java at least, different languages have different 
		implementations) and can be written as lambda expressions. They are sucessors of functors in C++
		or function pointers in C. Their main purpouse is allowing the functions to be passed around as if they were objects 
		(data types).

		So, the Consumer type in javaDaemon is a class that encapsulates an event loop thread that executes all Runables and 
		Closures dispatched to it by other threads. Consumer can be the GUI thread or it can be a standalone thread, however the 
		developer chooses to implement it.

	The Daemon:

		Daemon is the other part of the framework, the main part, the thing that that the framework is named after. Daemon is 
		named after daemon process in unix like OSes, not the java daemon thread, because threads in javaDaemon are user 
		threads, and will be waited for by JVM to run out of scope. Of course, it can be made daemon, as in java daemon thread, 
		but I never had the need to.

		In that sense, a daemon is a long-running background process that answers requests for services. The term originated 
		with Unix, but most operating systems use daemons in some form or another...
		Nevermind, I just thought its a cool name.

		The Daemon represents users (developers) class instance or object in form of an active object. Active object because it 
		encapsulates a dedicated thread (or more than one).
		Any kind of user defined class can be used as a prototype for a Daemon. Furthermore, all the logic of users methods and 
		state of the member fields are undisturbed by presence of Daemons.
		(I've pondered on writing an epic fantasy novel about a small and miserable POJO object, which obtains a Daemon armor 
		and sets off in series of adventures along the continent of Java :))

		So, basically, Daemon is a class wrapper for developers written prototype class. It accepts users prototype class as a 
		constructor parameter, encapsulating the reference to it, and maps marked (annotated) PUBLIC, user written, 
		prototype method to their asynchronous counterpart, where instead of prototype methods return value of <ReturnType>,
		a new parameter of type Closure<ReturnType> (or Runnable if method returns void) is added, 
		so user can use it to extend the calling logic.

		Just public methods. Privates and protecteds access modifiers make no sense in this context, thus enforcing the user 
		class API. Still dont know what to do with static methods...

		It could be said that, underneath, Daemons also function by following the producer consumer scenario. Actually, they can 
		also be considered consumers, if you think of the scope 
		that made the method call as a producer. But, from another point of view, Daemons are producers. They produce the return 
		value of the users class method and dispatch it to 
		the Consumer via Closures.

		For each prototype marked method there is a little class generated that carries all of the arguments with it - I call it 
		the Quest :).
		Every marked method gets its own subtype of a Quest class with different params, mirroring the signature of the marked 
		user method. As there is a base Quest class for all of the methods, they can be enqueued to the call queue, upon which 
		the Daemon thread consumes, thus, effectivly calling the prototype method in Daemon threads context resolved by the type 
		of the quest. When the user method returns, Daemon dispatches its return value to the predefined Consumer in form of a 
		Closure or Runnable (if the method is void, but the caller needs to be notified that the method is done).

		Not all of the Daemons methods are asyncronous, just the marked ones. Because, obviously, simple methods like acessors 
		dont need to be executed asynchronously.

		So when the Daemons async method is called, the call is enqueued to one of the Daemons thread engine call queues, and 
		calling thread returns immediately (definition of asynchronous execution). The fact that it returns immediately allows 
		the call to be made from a Consumer, so the consumer can continue looping and serving other Daemons and their Closures.

		In that way, Daemons and Consumers complement each other.

Allright, but how do I use it?

	Annotations.

	Another great tool of the Java compiler. There are lots of usages for annotations, and here, its the boilerplate code 
	generation. In javaDaemon, boilerplate is the multithreading code. With annotations developer can mark a class to be processed 
	in compile time, and with a little build process configuration, a Daemon wrapper class is generated.
	
	Daemon generated classes take the form of service objects and implement the start() and stop() methods, understanadbly, as they 
	extend the functionality of threads. So, instancing a Daemon isnt enough, it has to be explictly started and stopped.
	
	Class to be "daemonized" is annotated with @Daemon, and a method that is chosen by a developer to execeute asynchronously, with
	@Daemonize. There are various options for fine tunning but they would take quite a bit of explaining. Another mode of service
	configurartion is @SideQuest method annotation. This annotation is used to mark a method that should constantly execute, over 
	and over, until stopped, with or without pauses.
	
	There are constraints in usage, for sure. Like @SideQuest method cant take in any parameters, and more for other kinds of modes,
	but that will be explained in depth some other time.
	
	An example:

		@Daemon(doubleDaemon = true)
		public interface MovableAnimator extends .... {

			@Daemonize
			public boolean goTo(int x, int y, float velocity);

			@SideQuesta(SLEEP = 25)
			public PositionedImage animate();
		}	
	
	Here is an abstraction that describes a movable object in 2D plane. @SideQuest will make sure that a dedicated thread engine
	will be generated to call animate method every 25ms. 
	Any concrete implementation of that interface can contain specfic animation techniques and allows the developer to
	annotate an interface and use it with any implementation they like.
	
	Animate method returns PositionedImage object which contains new x and y coords, as well as the current image (from sprite)
	to be drawn.
	
	Go to method calculates, lets say, the direction and velocity of the Movable object, wait for animation engine to actually
	draw this frame by frame, and return the outcome. Because it will have its own thread of execution, it can rest on a codition or 
	a semaphore until animating thread engine is done.
	
	Daemon looks like this:

		public class MovableAnimatorDaemon {

			private MovableAnimator prototype;

			private EagerMainQuestDaemonEngine mainEngine;
			private SideQuestEngine sideEngine;

			MovableDaemon(Consumer consumer, MovableAnimator prototype) {
				this.prototype = prototype;
				//init engines...
			}

			public MovableAnimatorDaemon goTo(int x, int y, float velocity, Closure<Boolean> closure) {
				//enqueue goTo on EagerMainQuestDaemonEngine mainEngines call queue...
				return this;
			}

			public SideQuest setAnimateSideQuest(Consumer consumer) {
				//init quest for animation and configure it to run on sideEngine...
				return sideQuest;
			}

			//quests definitions and stuff...
		}
	
	And, the usage:
	
		...

		Consumer gameConsumer; //consumer dedicated to executing game logic
		Consumer renderer; //consumer dedicated to rendering aka. The Renderer

		...

		//instantination - Bridge pattern
		MovableAnimatorDaemon movable = new MovableAnimatorDaemon(gameConsumer, new SpecificImplemetationOfMovable(...))
						.setName("SpecificImplemetationOfMovable Daemon");

		//sideQuest config
		movable.setAnimateSideQuest(renderer).setClosure(ret -> {
			PositionedImage posImg = ret.get();
			correspondingView.setX(posImg.getX())
					 .setY(posImg.getY())
					 .setImage(posImg.getImage());
		});

		//start the daemon and go to specific coords
		movable.start().goTo(someX, someY, someVelocity, ret -> {
			if (ret.get()) { //if the movable has arrived do some more logic
				//fire bullet or land a mine or whatever
				//and if damaged get some healing...
			} else
				movable.stop();
		});

		//or just go to another coords
		movable.goTo(firstX, firstY, firstVel, ret -> if (ret.get()) movable.goTo(secondX, secondY, secondVel, ret2 -> ...));

		//or use anon class as closure and get the Closures this ptr
		//and lock the movable in a multithreaded recursion
		//also a signature of Closure can be seen
		movable.goTo(x, y, vel, new Closure<Boolean> {
			@Override
			public void onReturn(Return<Boolean> ret) {
			
				//guard against invalid return
				//Return class has addtitonal logic for exception handling 
				if(!ret.get()) { 
					movable.stop();
					return;
				}
			
				//do the logic
				//calculate next x, y , velocity
				//and then go to next coords with the same closure allocated here
				movable.goTo(nextX, nextY, nextVel, this::onReturn);
			}
		});
		
	Now, some of the reactions I got from developers I consulted with is about calling generated code.
	
So, how is this implemented?

	There are two components to JavaDaemon. They are directly translated to two libraries. 

	Daemonengine is a runtime library that provides thread plumbing via engines that make Daemons run in different threads.
	Daemonprocessor is a compile time component, a library with an entrypoint in a specialized Java Annotation processor.

	When configured in a project the Daemonprocessor scans the project for annotated classes. When it finds them it generates 
	Daemons.
	As said, 

	//JavaPoet praise
	//platform code abstraction

Pros and cons (constraints)

	//Multiplatform programming and Gradle build tools and MOE research
	//OOP iheritance and polymorphism
	//Design patterns and SOLID
	//Division of class methods by the executing thread
	//Synchronization...

Why games? And why Java?

	I know that Java developers code with little care about programs performances, since Java is used for non preformance
	critical applications or backend apps which run on superbuff mighty servers. Furthermore, this kind of usage and the fact
	that it began with the rise of internet and web programming, had dubbed Java as a "slow" language in terms of execution 
	performance. Sure, its slower than C/C++, because there is some interpretation by JVM, but today, with this kind of hardware 
	that is used even in mobile devices, and some performance optimization skills, I have no doubt that a game of modest size, at 
	least, can be made with a lot less effort than before.
